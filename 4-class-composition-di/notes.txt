This attempts to add logging by creating a class which adds logging to ThingRequest by having an instance of
ThingRequest injected into it.

Dependency Injection - a fancy term for passing a class it's dependencies.

Say I have a class ValidatedThingRequest whose constructor instantiates a ThingRequest for use in ValidatedThingRequest.
Now ValidatedThingRequest has a dependency on ThingRequest, but notice that:

1. This dependency isn't explicit, which means it's harder to find and easier to break ValidatedThingRequest when you
change ThingRequest.
2. ValidatedThingRequest is not responsible for creating and destroying that instance of ThingRequest.
3. It's also harder to test ValidatedThingRequest since we can easily supply a mocked ThingRequest.

Dependency injection solves all these issues:
